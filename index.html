      <p> In his humble beginnings, Daniel was raised in New York City, New York and went on to attend the prestigious Harvard University, but we all know he is intelligence is far beyond measure. He adapted the British version of "The Office" and turned it into a true masterpiece. In 2009, Daniels was approached by a friend who asked to make a spin-off of The Office starring a female lead. From there, the TV-show "Parks and Recreation" was born. Although he is best known for his work on "The Office," he has worked on several other projects, such as The Simpsons and Saturday Night Live. He is happily married to his wife, Susanne Dari Lieberstein, and they have 4 children together. He has won 4 Emmy awards out of the 20 he was nominated for, all rewarding his work from several different projects. Through his work, especially on The Office, he has touched many lives and will continue to do so for many generations to come.
